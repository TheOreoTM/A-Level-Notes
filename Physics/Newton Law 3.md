- Newton's Third Law states:
	_**If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert a force on body A of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction**_

- This means that every force has a paired equal and opposite force
    - Newton’s Third Law force pairs must act on two **different** objects
    - Newton’s Third Law force pairs must also be of the **same type** e.g. gravitational or frictional
