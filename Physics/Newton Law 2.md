- Newton's Second Law states that:
	**The resultant force on an object is equal to its rate of change in momentum.**

- This change in momentum is in the **same direction** as the resultant force
- Or, in other words:
	**The resultant force on an object with constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration.**

- This change in momentum is in the **same direction** as the resultant force
- This can also be written as:
$$F = \text{ma}$$
