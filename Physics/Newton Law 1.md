Apparently you dont need this? But here you go.

- Newton's First Law states:
	_**A body will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force**_

- If the forces on a body are balanced (the resultant force is 0), the body must be either:
    - At rest
    - Moving at a constant velocity

- Since force is a vector, it is easier to split the forces into **horizontal** and **vertical** forces

- If the forces are balanced:
    
    - The forces to the left = the forces to the right
    - The forces up = the forces down

- The resultant force is the single force obtained by combining **all** the forces on the body
