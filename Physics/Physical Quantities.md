- Any quantity that can be measured
- It is represented with a **number** & a **unit**
 - Number - Value or magnitude 
 - Unit - Identify the physical quantity

### Examples

### Notes
> 1 mole of anything = 6.023x10²³ molecules

> Kinetic Energy = E<sub>k</sub>
> Potential Energy = E<sub>p</sub>

> Speed = ms⁻¹
> Acceleration = ms⁻²
> Density = kgm⁻³

> distance/displacement = s
> speed/velocity = v
