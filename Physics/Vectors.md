Representation of a vector:
![[representation of vectors.excalidraw]]
> Vectors going `Up/Right` are considered as +ve Vectors
> Vectors gong `Down/Left` are considered as -ve Vectors

## Addition of Vectors

### Case 1
> Vectors act in the same direction
![[Vectors 2023-10-13 18.30.57.excalidraw]]
### Case 2
![[Vectors 2023-10-13 18.37.49.excalidraw]]
![[Vectors 2023-10-13 18.41.36.excalidraw]]
### Case 4
> Parallelogram Method
![[Vectors 2023-10-13 18.45.20.excalidraw]]
### Notes
---
$-10N = +10N$
$-2ms^{-1} = 2ms^{-1}$
$-5ms^{-2} = 5ms^{-2}$
