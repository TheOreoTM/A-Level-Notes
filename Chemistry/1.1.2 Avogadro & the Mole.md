- The **Avogadro constant** ($L$ or $N_{A}$) is the number of particles equivalent to the relative **atomic** **mass** or **molecular mass** of a substance
    - The Avogadro constant applies to atoms, molecules, ions and electrons

- The value of $L$ is $6.02 \times 10^{23} \space g \space mol^{-1}$
- The mass of a substance with this number of particles is called a **mole** (mol)
    - This can be called the **molar mass** 
    - This is the mass of substance that contains the same number of fundamental units as exactly 12.00g of carbon-12
- The amount/number of moles of a substance, $n$, the mass of the substance, $m$, and the molar mass, $M$, are linked by the equation:
$$n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{Molar mass }} = \frac{m}{mr}$$
- One mole of any element is equal to the relative atomic mass of that element in grams
    - If you had one mole of carbon in your hand, that is $6.02\times 10^{23}$ atoms of carbon, you would have a mass of 12.00 g
    - One mole of water would have a mass of $(2 \times 1 + 16 = 18 \text{ g})$

>[!done] Answer
>1. Molar mass of water, $H_{2}O = (2 \times 1.0) + 16.0 = 18.0 \space g \space mol^{-1}$ 
>2. Moles = $\frac{m}{mr} = \frac{100}{18.0} =$ 5.56 moles (to 3 s.f.)
>3. Number of molecules = $n \times L = 5.56 \times (6.02\times10^{23}) = 3.35\times 10^{24}$ molecules

> [!done] Answer 1
> $$n = \frac{X}{L} = \frac{500\times10^{6}}{6.02\times10^{23}} = 8.31\times10^{-16}$$ $$m = n \times mr = (8.31\times 10^{-16}) \times 195.1 = 1.62 \times 10^{-13} g$$

> Molar mass of ethanol = $46.0\space g\space mol^{-1}$
> $$n = \frac{X}{L} = \frac{1.31\times 10^{22}}{6.02\times10^{23}} = 0.0218 \text{ moles}$$
> $$m = n \times mr = 0.0218 \times 46.0 = 1.00 \text{ g}$$

>[!summary] Exam Tip
> - When you are completing calculations using Avogadro's constant, you may end up with answers that seem very large or very small - don't automatically assume that they must be wrong
> - Remember, Avogadro's constant is a VERY large number:
> 	- 6.02 x 1023 or 602 000 000 000 000 000 000 000
> - So when you multiply or divide by Avogadro's constant, your answers will, naturally, become very large or very small
