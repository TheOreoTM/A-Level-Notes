### Writing & Balancing Equations

- A **symbol** equation is a shorthand way of describing a chemical reaction using **chemical symbols** to show the number and type of each atom in the reactants and products
- A **word** equation is a longer way of describing a chemical reaction using only **words** to show the reactants and products

#### Balancing equations

- During chemical reactions, atoms cannot be **created** or **destroyed**
- The number of each atom on each side of the reaction must therefore be the **same**
    - E.g. the reaction needs to be **balanced**

- When balancing equations remember:  
    - Not to change any of the formulae
    - To put the numbers used to balance the equation **in front** of the formulae
    - To balance firstly the carbon, then the hydrogen and finally the oxygen in **combustion reactions** of organic compounds

- When balancing equations follow the following the steps:   
    - Write the formulae of the reactants and products
    - Count the numbers of atoms in each reactant and product
    - Balance the atoms one at a time until all the atoms are balanced
    - Use appropriate state symbols in the equation

- The **physical state** of reactants and products in a chemical reaction is specified by using **state symbols**
    - **(s)** solid
    - **(l)** liquid[^1]
    - **(g)** gas
    - **(aq)** aqueous

#### Formulae for Ionic Compounds

- The formulae of simple ionic compounds can be calculated if you know the charge on the ions
- Below are some common ions and their charges:

#### Common Ions & Their Charges Table

| Ion                | Formula & Charge |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Iron (III)         | $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ |
| Copper(II)         | $\text{Cu}^{2+}$ |
| Chromium(III)      | $\text{Cr}^{3+}$ |
| Ammonium           | $NH^{+}_{4}$     |
| Hydroxide          | $OH^{-}$         |
| Nitrate            | $NO^{-}_{3}$     |
| Sulfate            | $SO^{2-}_{4}$    |
| Carbonate          | $CO^{2-}_{3}$    |
| Hydrogen Carbonate | $HCO^{-}_{3}$                 |

- For ionic compounds you have to balance the charge of each part by multiplying each ion until the sum of the charges = 0
- Example: what is the formula of aluminium sulfate?
    - Write out the formulae of each ion, including their charges
    - $Al^{3+}$ $SO^{2-}_{4}$

- Balance the charges by multiplying them out:
	-  $Al^{3+} \times 2 = +6$ and $SO^{2-}_{4} \times 3 = -6$; so $+6 - 6 = 0$
- So the formula is $Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}$

>[!summary] Exam Tip
> Another method that also works is to 'swap the numbers'.
> 
> In the example above the numbers in front of the charges of the ions (3 and 2) are swapped over and become the multipliers in the formula (2 and 3).
> 
> Easy when you know how!

> 
> **Step 4:** Use appropriate **state symbols** in the fully balanced equation
> $$2Mg (s) + O_{2} (g) \rightarrow 2MgO (s)$$

> #### Ionic equations
> - In aqueous solutions ionic compounds **dissociate** into their ions
> - Many chemical reactions in aqueous solutions involve ionic compounds, however only some of the ions in solution take part in the reactions
> - The ions that do **not** take part in the reaction are called **spectator ions**
> - An **ionic equation** shows **only** the ions or other particles taking part in a reaction, and not the spectator ions

[^1]: Only water can be liquid, everything else that you think that *might* be liquid is probably **aqueous**

[^2]: A spectator ion is **an ion that does not take part in the chemical reaction and is found in solution both before and after the reaction**. **BUT** in the case of an ionic reaction you can just check for the ions that are in both sides with the **same** charge
