- This may look like a lot but its really not that much, just some basic definitions and formulae that you probably already know
## Formulae - Definitions
#### Basic terms
There are basic terms that you are expected to know from O'Levels
##### Atom
> A single particle
> The **smallest** part of an element that can participate in a chemical reaction
##### Element
>  An **atom** or group of atoms of only one type, which ***can*** be chemically joined not
>  A substance that ***cannot*** be broken down into simpler substances
##### Ion
> An atom that has become ***electrically*** charged
> An atom (or group of atoms) that has gained or lost electrons to become a charged species
##### Molecule
> Two or more *atoms* ***chemically joined*** together
##### Compound
> A substance with two or more *elements* ***chemically joined*** together
##### Mixture 
> Two or more elements that are ***physically combined***
##### Empirical formula
> The smallest whole-number ratio of atoms (of each element) in a compound/molecule
##### Molecular formula
> The actual number of atoms (of each element) in a compound/molecule
##### Proton/Atomic number
> The number of protons present in a nucleus of an atom
##### Mass/Nucleon number
> The total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom
##### Mole
> The amount of substance in grams that has the same number of particles as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12
##### Molar mass 
>It is the mass in grams of 1 mole of substance
#### Relative atomic mass
> The average mass of one atom compared to $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of carbon-12

## Mass - Definitions

- The relative mass of an atom uses the carbon-12 isotope as the international standard 
- One atom of carbon-12 has an accepted mass of $1.992646538 \times 10^{26} \space kg$
- It is not realistic to work with this value so the mass of a carbon-12 atom is fixed as exactly 12 atomic mass units (or) $12\upsilon$
	- NOTE: $\upsilon$ is not `v` its more like a `u`. This is what it looks like in plain text: **υ**. So keep that in mind if you for whatever reason want to write it.
- The standard mass for atomic mass is $1\upsilon$
    - Therefore, the standard mass for comparison is the mass of $\frac{1}{12}$ of a carbon-12 atom

##### Relative isotopic mass

- Relative isotopic mass is defined as the mass of an isotope relative to $\frac{1}{12}$ of a carbon-12 atom
- For A Level Chemistry it is common to work with mass values rounded to one decimal place, for example:
- The accurate relative isotopic mass of nitrogen is `14.00307401` but this is rounded to `14.0`
- The accurate relative isotopic mass of oxygen is `15.99491464` but this is rounded to `16.0`

##### Relative atomic mass

- Most elements on the Periodic Table represent a mixture of different isotopes, which is shown as their relative atomic mass ($A_{r}$) 
- The relative atomic mass is the weighted mean / average mass of an atom relative to $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom

- We have seen previously that the symbol for the relative atomic mass is $A_{r}$
- This is calculated from the **mass number** and **relative abundances** of all the **isotopes** of a particular element
- The symbol for the **relative formula mass** is $M_{r}$ and it refers to the **total mass** of the substance
    - The term relative formula mass should be used for compounds with giant structures e.g. ionic compounds such as sodium chloride
    - If the substance is molecular you can use the term **relative molecular mass**
- To calculate the $M_{r}$ of a substance, you have to add up the **relative atomic masses** of all the atoms present in the formula

##### Relative **Formula** Mass Calculations Table
| **Substance**                                | **Atoms present**                              | $M_{r}$                                      |
|:---------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------ |:-------------------------------------------- |
| Hydrogen ($H_{2}$)                       | $2 \times H$                                | $2 \times 1 = 2$                              |
| Water ($H_{2}O$)                         | $(2 \times H) + (1 \times O)$                | $(2 \times 1) + 16 = 18$                      |
| Potassium Carbonate <br>($K_{2}CO_{3}$) | $(2 \times K) + (1 \times C) + (3 \times O)$  | $(2 \times 39) + (1 \times 12) + (3 \times 16) = 138$ |
| Calcium Hydroxide <br>($Ca(OH)_{2}$)    | $(1 \times Ca) + (2 \times O) + (2 \times 1)$ | $40 + (2 \times 16) + (2 \times 1) = 74$                                             |


> [!summary] Exam Tip
>  It is expected that you will use relative atomic mass values from the Periodic Table
> - This means that your values will be more accurate
> - e.g. potassium carbonate = (2 x 39.1) + 12.0 + (3 x 16.0) = 138.2>
>
> If you are in any doubt whether to use relative molecular mass or relative formula mass, use the latter because it applies to all compounds whether they are ionic or covalent.
