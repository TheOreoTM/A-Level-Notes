## Empirical & Molecular

#### Empirical formula

- **Empirical formula** is the **simplest whole number ratio** of the elements present in one molecule or formula unit of the compound
- It is calculated from knowledge of the ratio of masses of each element in the compound
- The empirical formula can be found by determining the **mass** of each element present in a sample of the compound
- It can also be deduced from data that gives the **percentage compositions by mass** of the elements in a compound

> - The **molecular formula** gives the exact numbers of atoms of each element present in the formula of the compound
> - The molecular formula can be found by dividing the **relative** **formula** **mass** of the **molecular formula** by the **relative formula mass** of the **empirical formula**
> - **Multiply** the number of each element present in the empirical formula by this number to find the molecular formula

> **Calculating molecular formula**
> 
> The empirical formula of X $C_{4}H_{10}S$ and the relative molecular mass of X is 180.2
> What is the molecular formula of X?
> 
> ($A_{r}$ data: C = 12.0, H = 1.0, S = 32.1 )

> [!done] Answer
> **Step 1:** Calculate relative mass of the empirical formula
> 
> - Relative empirical mass = (C x 4) + (H x 10) + (S x 1)
> - Relative empirical mass = (12.0 x 4) + (1.0 x 10) + (32.1 x 1)
> - Relative empirical mass = 90.1
> 
> **Step 2:** Divide relative molecular mass of **X** by relative empirical mass
> -  Ratio between $M_{r}$ of X and the $M_{r}$ of the empirical formula = $\frac{180.2}{90.1}$
> - Ratio between $M_{r}$ of X and the $M_{r}$ of the empirical formula = 2
> 
> **Step 3:** Multiply each number of elements by 2
> - $(C_{4} \times 2) + (H_{10} \times 2) + (S \times 2) = (C_{8}) + (H_{20}) + (S_{2})$
> - Molecular Formula of **X** is $C_{8}H_{20}S_{2}$
>  
> #### Percentage Composition by Mass
> - The percentage by mass of an element in a compound can be calculated using the following equation:
> $$\text{\% mass of an element = }\frac{A_{r} \times \text{number of atoms of the element}}{M_{r}} \times 100$$

> Calculate the percentage by mass of calcium in calcium carbonate, $CaCO_{3}$

#### Ideal Gas Equation

- The **ideal gas equation** is: 
$$PV = nRT$$
- Where:
	-  _P_ = pressure in pascals (Pa)
	- _V_ = volume in cubic metres (m3)
	- _n_ = the amount of substance in moles (mol)
	- _R_ = the gas constant, which is given in the Data Booklet as $8.31 \space J \space mol^{-1} \space K^{-1}$
	- _T_ = temperature in Kelvin (K)

>[!summary] Exam Tip
> There are several calculations in Chemistry where you need to convert the units to or from SI units
> 
> The ideal gas equation has three:
> 1. Pressure is often quoted in $\text{kPa}$ but the calculation needs pressure in $\text{Pa}$
> 2. Volume is usually quoted in $\text{cm}^{3}$ or $\text{dm}^{3}$ but the calculation needs volume in $\text{m}^{3}$
> 3. Temperature can be quoted in Kelvin or Celsius
> 
> You can convert them using the [[Conversions|conversions table]]
> 
> This is why you should always show your working! Examiners can't take all of your marks for one error, if you show your working then they should check through for errors and award marks accordingly

- The ideal gas equation can be used to find the amount of moles in a gaseous substance
    - It can also be used for volatile liquids at temperatures above their boiling point
- If the mass of the substance is known, then the molar mass can be calculated
    - This can then be used with empirical formula data to determine the molecular formula of a compound

>>Note: This is unlikely to come in an exam but its still good to know how to solve these type of questions
> 
> An unknown compound was analysed and found to contain 66.7% of carbon, 11.1% hydrogen and the remainder was oxygen
> 
> 0.135 g of the unknown compound had a volume of 56.0 $cm^{3}$ at a temperature of $90\degree C$ and a pressure of $101 kPa$
> 
> Determine the molecular formula of the unknown compound

> [!done] Answer
> **Step 1:** Calculate the number of moles of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen

> 
> **Step 3:** State the empirical formula
> - The empirical formula is $C_{4}H_{8}O$
>   
> **Step 4:** Calculate the amount in moles, using $PV = nRT$
>  - $$n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(101\times 10^{3}) \times (56.0 \times 10^{-6})}{8.31 \times (90 + 273)} = 1.875\times 10^{-3} \text{ moles}$$
>    
> **Step 5:** Calculate the molar mass
> - $$\text{Molar mass } = \frac{0.135}{1.875\times 10^{-3}} = 72$$
>   
> **Step 6:** Deduce the molecular formula
> - The empirical formula, $C_{4}H_{8}O$, has a mass of (4 x 12.0) + (8 x 1.0) + 16.0 = 72.0
> - Therefore, the molecular formula is also $C_{4}H_{8}O$,
