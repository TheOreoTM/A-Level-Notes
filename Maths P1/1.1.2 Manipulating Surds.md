#### What are surds?
- If **_n_** is a positive integer and is not a square number, then $\sqrt{n}$ (or any multiple of $\sqrt{n}$ ) is a **surd**

- Surds are examples of [[Irrational Number|irrational numbers]]

#### What do I need to know about manipulating surds?
- There are two basic rules you need to know in order to manipulate and simplify surds:

- When simplifying, look for square factors

- You can collect like terms with surds like you do with letters in algebra:

- But be careful not to confuse this with the multiplication and division rules... cannot add or subtract 'under the surd':

#### Where can surds be useful?

- Using surds lets you leave answers in exact form
    - e.g. $\sqrt[5]{2}$ rather than `7.071067812`
- Understanding how to simplify surds can help reduce expressions and collect like terms

> #examtip 
> Leaving answers in surd form can be really helpful when you need to carry an exact value through to another part of working
> When simplifying surds, remembering your [[Useful Notes#Exponents of 2|square numbers]] is really helpful!

> #example 
> Simplify $\sqrt{125} - \sqrt{45}$ giving your answer in the form $\text{a}\sqrt{5}$, where $\text{a}$ is an integer.
