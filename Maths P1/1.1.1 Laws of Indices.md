#### What do I need to know about laws of indices?
- Laws of indices allow you to simplify and manipulate expressions involving powers
- The index laws you need to know and use are summarized here:

#### Changing the base of a term

- Sometimes expressions involve different base values
- You can use index laws to change the base of a term to simplify an expression involving terms with different bases
    - For example $9^{4} = (3^{2})^{4} = 3^{2 \text{ x } 4} = 3^{8}$ 
    - Using the above can then help with problems like $9^{4} \div 3^{7} = 3^{8} \div 3^{7} = 3^{8 - 1} = 3^{1} = 3$

>  Index laws only work with terms that have the same base, so something like $2^{3} \cdot 5^{2}$ cannot be simplified using index laws

> #example 
> Given that $y = \frac{1}{27}x^{3}$ express each of the following in the form $kx^{n}$, where $k$ and $n$ are constants
> 	a) $y^{\frac{1}{3}}$
> 	b) $\frac{1}{9}y^{-2}$
