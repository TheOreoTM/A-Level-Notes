#### What does it mean to rationalise a denominator?

- Rationalising a denominator changes a fraction with surds in its denominator, into an equivalent fraction where the denominator is a [[Rational Number|rational number]] (usually an integer) and any surds are in the numerator

> #examtip 
> If an exam question asks you to give an answer, for example, "in the form $p+ q\sqrt{3}$, where $p$ and $q$ are rational numbers", this does NOT mean that $p$ and $q$ have to be integers, or positive!
> Remember: both integers and fractions (both positive and negative) are rational numbers

> #example
> Simplify $\frac{4-3\sqrt{3}}{5-\sqrt{3}}$ giving your answer in the form $p+ q\sqrt{3}$, where $p$ and $q$ are rational numbers.
