- **Radians** are an alternative to degrees for measuring angles

![[Pasted image 20231204213817.png]]

- 1 radian is the angle in a sector of radius 1 and arc length 1
- Radians are normally quoted in terms of π
- This leads to
    - **2π = 360°**
    - **π = 180°**
- The symbol for radians is **c** but it is more usual to see **rad**
    - Often, when π is involved, no symbol is given as it is obviously in radians
- Radians are used in **trigonometry** (see Exact Values) and **calculus** (First Principles Differentiation – Trigonometry)

#### How do I change between radians and degrees?

- The most common are below, these are helpful to know

- Multiples of these are quite common too, eg ¾π = 135°
- For less familiar angles use **π = 180°** to convert or the formula
	- To convert **radians** to **degrees**: 
		$\text{degrees} = \text{rad} \cdot \frac{180\textdegree}{\pi}$
	- To convert **degrees** to **radians**
		$\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180\degree}$

#### How do I use radians to find the length of an arc?
![[Pasted image 20231204214840.png]]

- The length of an arc is **s = rθ**

#### How do I use radians to find the area of a sector?
![[Pasted image 20231204214926.png]]

- The area of a sector is $A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot r^{2} \cdot \theta$

#### Solving problems with radians

- Other **angle**, **circle**, **area**, etc skills may be needed
- For example, area of a triangle $\frac{1}{2} \cdot ab \cdot \sin c$

> #examtip 
> Exam papers will have a mixture of questions in degrees and radians
> Check the mode (degrees/radians) of your calculator before using it
> Ensure you know how to change the mode on your calculator
> For the Casio fx-991ES PLUS
>  1. **SHIFT** then **MODE** **SETUP**
>  2. Choose either **3: DEG** or **4: RAD**

> #example 
> In the diagram below OPQ is the sector of a circle with radius 3 cm
> The length of the arc PQ is $\frac{9\pi}{4}$
> The angle at the centre of the circle is $\theta$, measured in radians.
> Find the area of the sector OPQ
